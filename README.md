### **React Concepts Used**

1. **Components**: 
   - Modular design with reusable parts like `Question` (displays a question) and `ToolTip` (hints/help).  

2. **State Management**: 
   - Tracks quiz progress, selected answers, and results using `useState`.  

3. **Props**: 
   - Passes data (e.g., questions, answers) between components.  

4. **CSS Modules**: 
   - Scoped styles (`.module.css`) to avoid conflicts.  

5. **Conditional Rendering**: 
   - Shows different screens (Quiz, Result, Review) based on state.  

6. **Hooks**: 
   - `useState` and `useEffect` manage app logic and dynamic data.

## Features and Functionality

### 1. **Landing Page**:
   - Displays instructions (from `instructions.js`) and a start button to enter the quiz.
   - Upon clicking the "Enter Quiz" button, the quiz timer starts, and the app transitions to the next step.

### 2. **Instructions Page**:
   - Displays clear instructions for the quiz.
   - After a brief 10-second delay, the app automatically moves to the quiz component.

### 3. **Quiz Component**:
   - Displays a series of shuffled questions (from `quizData.js`) with multiple-choice options.
   - Tracks user answers using React state and moves to the next question.
   - Questions are shuffled for each session to offer a fresh experience every time.

### 4. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can select one answer option per question.
   - Answers are stored in the app’s state for evaluation after completing the quiz.

### 5. **Submitting the Quiz**:
   - Once the user has answered all the questions, they click the "Finish" button.
   - The app calculates the user's final score by comparing their answers with the correct ones.

### 6. **Results Component**:
   - Displays the user's score and shows how many questions were answered correctly.
   - Includes two options:
     - **Review**: Allows users to compare their answers with the correct answers.
     - **Retake**: Provides an option to retake the quiz.

### 7. **Review Screen**:
   - After finishing the quiz, users can review the answers to compare what they answered with the correct responses.

### Additional Features:
   - **Randomized Questions**: The questions are shuffled for each session, ensuring a unique experience every time.
   - **Progress Chart**: Displays the progress of the quiz, allowing users to track their journey.
